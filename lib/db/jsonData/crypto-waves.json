All that said, the blue potential is high speculative at this time as the pattern off the August low looks very corrective upwards (despite its inability to breakdown) and is relegated to a very lousy LD wave (i) at best.Regarding the main count: this consolidation is getting quite protracted but until price gets a sustained break over 3215-3220, or 5 up (or ideally both), I don't have any highly confident reason to consider a lasting bottom having been struck",
